# Approval
A short script that normalizes technical majors based on common classes among other technical majors. The concept for the project came along from a recent change in one of my club's policies and the creation of new committee to select more majors to accept into our group. 

While this is still a work in progress, the main idea is entering a list of the technical classes that is seperated by commas when prompted, and then each class is looked at and matched to a point value. For a major to be accepted, it has to reach a minimum number of points based on the current majors we accepted as of 2018. The minimum was calculated as rough average. 

# Additional Features Planned
	* GUI or Colors in Command Prompt
	* Additional classes added
	* More specific point system
	* Better input system
	* Seperation of constants to different file
